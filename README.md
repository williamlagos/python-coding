# chess
Simple chess engine written in Python with standard library. Works with Python 3.x. The execution
is quite simple: you just have to specify the width (-m) and height (-n) of the chessboard and the
number of pieces that you want to test:

```
python chess.py -m 3 -n 3 -K 2 -R 1
```

To execute the unit tests included, it's even simpler. The code is 100% covered by the test cases
developed in this project.

```
python tests.py
```
